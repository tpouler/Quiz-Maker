## Design checklist

[X] The Product backlog is populated with epic user stories  
[X] There are some lo-fi storyboards with the initial design thoughts  
[X] There are some CRC cards for the main "nouns" in the project

Comments:

For the CRC cards, you should be aiming at capturing the data model of the system. The list of things the Professor "knows" is probably not how you would implement that. You should take another swing at this thinking about some of the things we talked about with respect to data modeling in class. You probably want some more nouns like Course, or Question Bank.

The storyboard looks like a start, but it looks like there is a lot missing. I hope you continue to flesh that out before you go too much further.

The user stories look pretty good. There is a little redundancy in the reporting. Sometimes you will get multiple user stories that basically distill down to the same feature. I think it is good to coalesce them into a single action item. You can just put the variants in the comments to inform the design when you get to making the feature.
